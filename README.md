# React Info Site
This is my first react application, a static webpage about react information. This project was made using Scrimba.

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```

Happy Coding!
